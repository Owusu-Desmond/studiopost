    - [] **Main topics**: Ruby on Rails

    # What is Ruby on Rails?

    Ruby on Rails is an open-source server-side web application framework with an MIT license. While Ruby on Rails is written in Ruby, a dynamic, general-purpose programming language from Japan; RoR is in fact a framework, not a language. Many entrepreneurs and non-developers often confuse the two, thinking Rails when hearing Ruby but rarely the other way around.
    
    ## Why I like Ruby on Rails

    A Rails developer can easily test features with a user base by developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Developed in a matter of days, MVP ensures that the product is on track and is approved by the clients and the users.

    But this software development procedure of start-ups is often restricted by budget and time.
    
    Therefore, it is critical to search for the right Ruby on Rails development company that would function with the programming tools available.
    
    Below are a few reasons stating why RoR is good for creating an MVP:

    - **Speed**: Ruby on Rails is a fast framework that allows developers to create a web application in a matter of days. It is also easy to learn and use, which is why it is the most popular framework for startups.

    - **Security**: Ruby on Rails provides a secure environment for developers to create web applications. It also has a built-in security feature that protects the application from hackers and other threats.

    - **Scalability**: Ruby on Rails is a scalable framework that allows developers to create a web application that can be easily scaled up or down depending on the needs of the users.
